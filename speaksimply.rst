Speak simply - hints for Finnish speakers
=========================================

People *can and do* learn Finnish all the time, but many people end up
not for years and years.  Certainly the high penetration of English is
part of that.  This page gives some hints on how Finnish speakers can
help Finnish learners, because after all immersion and daily usage is
key to learning any language.

Finnish has many dialects, and the form we learn in classes isn't even
what most people speak.  So, a bit of help can help us to learn much
better.


Talk about unimportant things
-----------------------------
It's easy to speak Finnish - you just don't speak.  But that doesn't
help learning.

I have said "if it's not important, I can understand Finnish well.  If
it's important, I usually can't understand much."  What this basically
means that, if something is important, you end up switching to English
because we have stuff to get done.  Try to talk about unimportant
things.


Ask people about what they are learning
---------------------------------------
Ask people about what they are learning in classes, so you know what
level they are at and what types of topics they know about.  That way
you know how far to go and what the general progression is.  Our
textbooks tend to go in themes for each chapter, if you're talking
about something that we haven't covered yet, we'll have no idea how to
listen or speak.  Same for different word forms, etc.

Suomen Mestari is the most often used book these days (for adults),
and this is roughly how it goes.  One book is roughly half a year for
a non-intensive course:

Don't give up
-------------
Don't give up when speaking Finnish to people... they may be slow
responding, but that's OK.  Since you're talking about unimportant
things, you can take some time.


Use Finnish words
-----------------
Have to think about a word in English?  Say the Finnish one first,
help the person learn it.  Maybe even just say the Finnish one and
leave it at that, let the person learn it.  Maybe even try
intentionally using Finnish words.  This is easiest with nouns but you
could try others, too.


Try to separate words well
--------------------------
Finnish flows well, but this means that it can be hard to tell the
words apart.  Don't make it unnatural, but don't try to be as fast as
you can.  Can you make the separation of the words a bit easier to
tell?  We tell them not just by spaces, but also by emphasis of the
first syllable of each word.


Try to articulate words well, especially the ends
-------------------------------------------------
In Finnish, you have to be able to understand words from both the
front and end (because the ends have the forms).  But often times the
ends vanish, change, or otherwise are hard to pick up.  When that
happens, us learners aren't able to pick up what is said - and
possible can't understand the whole sentence.  If you optimize the
ends of words (as spoken Finnish does), we can't figure out what you
are trying to say.


Consider your puhekieli
-----------------------
It takes a long time for people to begin learning any spoken
language - so if you are talking to beginners, they won't have mental
preparation to understand what you are saying.  Of course it can be
hard to speak kirjekieli, so try to find a proper balance.  You can
expect we should learn the simplest puhekieli, but maybe try to
simplify some of the more advanced forms.  But of course add more as
time goes on.


Listen to bad Finnish
---------------------
Unlike some languages, there is less existing culture of hearing bad
Finnish on a daily basis.  So if someone tries to say something, but
says it only slightly wrong, the listener may have no idea what it
was.  This is frustrating, but more importantly switches the
conversation to English.  Be happy with bad Finnish and try to listen
to it.

I don't know if it's even possible to find bad Finnish to practice...


It's easier to read and write
-----------------------------
When mailing/messaging people, do use more simple Finnish even if they
might not know right away.  It's good practice.  When in a big
conversation with multiple people, mention them by name so that they
know that they should pay attention to understanding it.  When
writing, all the same things on this page apply (especially the
spelling the word endings out fully part).



Don't hide Finnish text
-----------------------
This isn't really a day-to-day speaking thing, but still somewhat
relevant.  Finland has a strong bilingual culture, but emphasis is
hiding the other language (put another way, making sure that language
A speakers never have to see language B).  But that's the opposite of
what you should do with English/Finnish translations: you should not
be worried if the untranslated articles appear in Finnish too.  Put
another way, consider the Aalto University websites.  When in English
mode, anything that isn't translated just disappears.  It would be
better to have it appear in Finnish still - it's easy to skip over if
you don't want it, but if you are learning it gives you exposure.
Plus you know that something exists.


Make domain-specific cheatsheets
--------------------------------
In many languages, advanced and technical terms are similar.  Not
necessarily in Finnish, yet these advanced terms are needed for work
and stuff - and not taught in any basic courses.  My idea is that
domains can make specific cheatsheets of common terms so that people
there can learn what is relevant to them.  If anyone wants to use
Hyvää Päivää to host this, let me know.
